## <a name="style">Coding Style</a>

This project uses [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as it's basic coding style. To enforce it's usage both [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) should be used to enforce all code changes and check for potential errors and warnings in the code.

This script is meant to find all cpp file changes according to a given list of files or to a git difference between the current branch and the origin/develop branch.

Options and usage vary according to project and use case. An example configuration to find the differences in the test_src directory exists in find_cpps/example_cfg. Run:

for usage details. 

## <a name="build">How to build</a>
